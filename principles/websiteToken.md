// View the List of Available Tokens

https://www.drupal.org/project/token


Any website uses a shared token system for exposing and using placeholder tokens and their appropriate replacement values. This allows for any module to provide placeholder tokens for strings without having to reinvent the wheel. To view a list of the currently available tokens on your site, you can navigate to the "Help > Token" (admin/help/token) page. For more information, covering both the token system and the additional tools provided by the Token module.
